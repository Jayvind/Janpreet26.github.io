        The Early Years Foundation Stage sets out the framework for early childhood learning, development and care. This covers the seven areas of learning that are split into prime and specific areas.

    <p class="heading">Observations and Assessments</p>
    <p class="text">
      We continually observe and assess our children to understand their development and to allow us to plan their progress across the seven areas of development. These are carried out during the child's play and are often used to extend a child's learning in that moment. These observations and assessments are provided to parents for their feedback and contribution, to gather a complete picture of the child's development at nursery and at home. We use the age band and developmental milestones in the <a href="https://www.early-education.org.uk/sites/default/files/Development%20Matters%20in%20the%20Early%20Years%20Foundation%20Stage%20-%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Development matters sheet</a> as an estimate of where a child should be, however we understand that each child is unique and will develop at their own pace. This is to ensure that no child falls behind in their development, as this can be a sign of a SEN. All of this data is tracked for each child in a cohort tracker.
